You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% blockquote Bobby Willis http://google.com/search?q=pants the search for bobby's pants %}
  Wheeee!
{% endblockquote %}

{% video http://site.com/video.mp4 720 480 http://site.com/poster-frame.jpg %}

{% img http://placekitten.com/200/300 Ninja Attack! %}
{% img left half http://placekitten.com/200/300 Ninja Attack! %}
{% img left half http://placekitten.com/200/300 150 150 "Ninja Attack!" "Ninja in attack posture" %}
